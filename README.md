# Geminio

Geminio is a capture/replay testing framework. It was originally developed to aid testing of CoTS IoT devices, but is useable in a lot of situations.

## Usage

Use the `com.stijndepestel.geminio.Capture` and the `com.stijndepestel.geminio.Replay` classes to capture and replay events. You can pass higher order functions to their constructors.

An example of how to use the framework can be found in the integration test. A more elaborate document will follow.
